OutsideMyWindow
===============

This is a small HTML5 canvas animation (with the help of kinetic.js) of the view from my bedroom. I went for a nice relaxed cartoony feel, watching the wind come in across the fields and over the turbines in the background.

It struggles a little performance wise, I'm not sure if I fell into some canvas/kinetic.js gotcha or if this kind of tech isn't quite up to scratch yet. Anyways enjoy!
